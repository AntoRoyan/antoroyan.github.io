Hi, I'm **Anto Royan**, a cheminformatician, data engineer, developer, and lifelong learner. Welcome to my personal blog, where I reflect on cheminformatics, science, programming, technology, and the journey of learning and building meaningful things.

I hold a Master’s degree in chemistry. I began my academic path fascinated by organic chemistry and stereochemistry, but soon realized I was more interested in the principles behind reactions, such as reactivity, energetics, kinetics, and structure–activity relationships. This interest led me to **molecular modeling**, and I completed my master's project in molecular dynamics, working on drug repurposing for Alzheimer’s disease.

My professional career began at Schrödinger as a **Data Scientist**, where I worked on scientific data curation, automated ETL workflows, and research support through data visualization and analysis. I built cheminformatics tools, machine learning models, and API-driven systems to make research more efficient and insightful. Currently, as a **Developer** on the data platform team, I work at the intersection of data engineering and web development, building internal platforms that streamline research, analytics, and experimentation.

*I'm passionate about bridging science, data, and technology to make scientific research smoother, faster, and more fun.*

Outside of work, I enjoy music, reading, movies, and playing badminton and cricket. A. R. Rahman's music has shaped much of my life. I also enjoy rock and post-rock, and recently I’ve been listening to Sigur Rós, a post-rock band from Iceland. Some of my favorite books are 'Letters of Vincent Van Gogh' by Vincent van Gogh, 'The Kite Runner' by Khaled Hosseini, 'The Stranger' by Albert Camus, and 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky. These days, I’m spending time reading Rumi.

## About the blog

I love learning new things, breaking them down, and building something with them. This blog is where I write about that process: whether it's science, cheminformatics, data, tech, programming, or thoughts from everyday life.
