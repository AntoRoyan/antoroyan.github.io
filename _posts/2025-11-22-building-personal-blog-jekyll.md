I set out to build a space for sharing ideas, documenting my learning journey, and connecting with others. Here’s how this blog came to life with Jekyll.

## **Design Inspiration**

The visual style and layout of this blog are inspired by the beautiful [Pulitzer WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/pulitzer/). I admired its focus on clean typography, minimalism.

## **The Vision**

I wanted to create more than just another blog. My goal was to build a platform where I could share my passion for:

- **Science & Cheminformatics** - Bridging chemistry and computer science
- **Data Analysis** - Extracting insights from complex datasets
- **Web Technologies** - Modern development practices and frameworks
- **Programming** - Code tutorials, best practices, and project walkthroughs
- **Life Reflections** - Personal growth and professional development

The challenge was creating something that felt personal, performed well, and could grow with my needs.

## **Why Jekyll?**

After evaluating various platforms, I chose Jekyll for several compelling reasons:

- **Simplicity**: Write in Markdown, deploy with Git - no complicated CMSs to manage.
- **Performance**: Static sites are lightning-fast with no database queries or server-side processing.
- **Developer Experience**: Full control over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with modern tooling.
- **GitHub Integration**: Free hosting on GitHub Pages with automatic deployments.
- **Future-Proof**: Plain text files ensure content portability and longevity.

## **The Development Journey**

Building this blog was an iterative process spanning several key phases:

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture**
I started with Jekyll's basic structure and built upon it:

- **Layouts System**: Created modular templates (`default.html`, `home.html`, `post.html`, `page.html`)
- **Component Architecture**: Organized SCSS into reusable components (`_navigation.scss`, `_posts.scss`, `_typography.scss`)
- **Configuration**: Set up `_config.yml` with proper SEO, pagination, and social integration

### **Phase 2: Design & Typography**
The visual identity focuses on readability and elegance:

- **Typography**: Implemented the beautiful Newsreader font for optimal reading experience
- **Color System**: Developed a minimal palette focused on content hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured perfect viewing across all devices and screen sizes
- **Grid Layouts**: Created flexible post layouts for different content types

### **Phase 3: Features & Functionality**
Added essential blog features while maintaining simplicity:

- **Tag System**: Manual tag pages for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Social Integration**: Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile links
- **Reading Time**: Automatic calculation for better user experience
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation
- **Pagination**: Clean navigation for browsing multiple posts
- **URL Structure**: Clean, SEO-friendly permalinks

## **Challenges Overcome**

### **Key Challenges**
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: No custom plugins, so I created manual tag pages and worked within supported features.
- **Performance**: Balanced rich typography with fast loading through font and CSS optimization.
- **Content Organization**: Planned a scalable structure for posts and tags.

## **The Technology Stack**

- **Core Framework**: Jekyll 4.x for static site generation
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain support
- **Styling**: SCSS with component-based architecture
- **Typography**: Newsreader font family for optimal readability
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
- **Version Control**: Git for content and code management

## **The Developer's Perspective**

Working on this blog was a fun and rewarding experience. I enjoyed figuring out how to make things look clean and work smoothly, and it was satisfying to see everything come together. Most of all, I liked having a place to share what I learn and connect with others who are interested in similar things.

If you're interested in the code, feel free to get in touch. I'm happy to share it!
